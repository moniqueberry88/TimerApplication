# TimerApplication

Application takes in user numeric input no larger than 99. after that the button disables until time runs out then the button is reenabled. 
i choose to do the ui in an constraint layout for its power to hold positoninig. i added an circle progress bar to make the countdown action seem more visible.
using kotlin coroutine to perform the looping of the numeric input on a background UI thread. and presenting the data on the main thread. displaying an dynamic
message a the start of the application and an different on when you the countdown is done
